# _Learning
A collection of stuff from courses, blogs, and videos that I've consumed. 

This is just a reference I keep as I learn to avoid having a million tiny, abandoned repositories.

Real projects that extend beyond consumed material belong in their own repository.

# Disclaimer
It is not my intention to infringe on copyrighted material by posting my version of your
course, blog, or video here.  If I have erroneously included material you
would like removed, please contact me and I would be happy to remove it.
