# Always Be Learning
A collection of stuff from courses, blogs, and videos that I've consumed, or projects

This is just a reference I keep as I learn to avoid having a million tiny, abandoned repositories.

Real projects that extend beyond consumed material or small prototypes belong in their own repository.
