# _Learning
A collection of stuff from courses, blogs, and videos that I've consumed, or projects
I've started with the intent of prototyping before formalizing into a real effort.

This is just a reference I keep as I learn to avoid having a million tiny, abandoned repositories.

Real projects that extend beyond consumed material or small prototypes belong in their own repository.

It is not my intention to infringe on copyrighted material by posting my version of your
course, blog, or video here.  If I have erroneously included material you
would like removed, please contact me and I would be happy to remove it.
